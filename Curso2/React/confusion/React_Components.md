# React components

## Presentational Components

No local state. The view is based on the props that are passed to it

## Container Components

Simply make use of presentational components and pass props to them and they are responsible for storing the state

## Functional Components

For components that simply work only using their props that are sent by their parent, there is an even simpler way of implementing the components what are called as Functional Components. Then we implement a simple function that returns a bunch of react elements
